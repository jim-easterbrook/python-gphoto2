Examples
========

This directory contains several example programs illustrating various aspects of using `python-gphoto2`.
Most of them are not intended to be complete or usable, they just show how to do one or two things.
You will probably need to experiment quite a bit, and make some changes, to get them to work with your camera(s) and do what you want to do.

Installing dependencies
-----------------------

Many of these example scripts require some Python dependencies. You can install all of them with::

    pip install -r requirements.txt
