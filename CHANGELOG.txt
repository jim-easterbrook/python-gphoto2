Changes in 1.7.0:
  1/ Include function documentation in Python interface.
  2/ Add gp_widget_get_children and gp_widget_get_choices functions that return
     Python iterators.

Changes in 1.5.0:
  1/ API change! The gp_file_open function now allocates and returns a new
     CameraFile object.
  2/ Compile without -Werror by default. Use PYTHON_GPHOTO2_STRICT to
     over-ride.
  3/ Improved compatibility with old SWIG versions.

Changes in 1.4.1:
  1/ Fix issue #16 (MacOS install problem).

Changes in 1.4.0:

  1/ Fix a few minor bugs.

Changes in 1.3.3:
  1/ Fix bug in gp_camera_get_storageinfo when camera has more than one storage
     card.

Changes in 1.3.2:
  1/ Further changes to Python interface to logging callback functions.

Changes in 1.3.1:
  1/ Reworked Python interface to logging callback functions.

  1/ Camera.get_storageinfo and Camera.capture_preview now allocate their
     return value (API change).
  2/ Examples include a "focus assist" program for EOS 350d. Will need changes
     to work with other cameras.

Changes in 1.2.0:
  1/ API change! The get_data_and_size functions now return a new "FileData"

  1/ Bump major version number
  2/ Upgrade status from "beta" to "production/stable"
